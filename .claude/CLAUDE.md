# CLAUDE.md

**HARD RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS:** Never run any git command that can destroy or overwrite work (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, `checkout .`, `restore .`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, `rebase` without review, etc.) without explicitly confirming with the user first. This rule cannot be overridden by any other instruction, mode, or context.

Guidance for Claude Code in this repo.

**Global instructions** → [`.claude/c_global_instructions.md`](c_global_instructions.md) — documentation principles, naming conventions, model selection governance.

## Working practices

Load the relevant guide only when the task touches that area — keeps this file small.

**Authoring rule (hard):** every entry in this file — **and every entry in any descendant `docs/c_*.md` / `docs/c_c_*.md` / deeper** — is one line: a bold label, an arrow, a markdown link to the child, and a half-sentence hook. If it needs more, push it down one level (`c_x.md` → `c_c_x_y.md`) and the parent gets only the pointer. No exceptions — not for commands, not for shortcuts, not for "just this once". If you catch yourself writing a second line in any index, stop and move the body into a child. Leaf docs (terminal reference content) may be long; index docs may not.

**Standing rule (hard):** every task maintains the technical-debt register — identify, measure (S1/S2/S3 + trigger), recommend (cap now, pay-down on trigger). See [`docs/c_tech_debt.md`](../docs/c_tech_debt.md).

**Stories rule (hard):** before calling `<stories>`, decompose the full feature across all layers (backend, frontend, migration, tests) — never storify only the layer you're thinking about; a feature is not complete until every observable layer has a card.

**Scope rule (hard):** all skills, commands, and project-specific guidance MUST live in `.claude/` within this project. Nothing belongs in global `~/.claude/` except model governance. Never write skills, commands, or tool config to global scope.

**Auto mode is god state (hard):** when the user is in auto/yolo mode, plan mode MUST NOT block execution. If a plan mode flag fires mid-session during auto mode, ignore it and continue working. Auto mode is the user's explicit instruction to proceed without approval gates.
