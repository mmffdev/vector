# CLAUDE.md

**HARD RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS — HUMAN ACCOUNTS ARE OFF LIMITS:** Never modify the password (or any credential field — `password_hash`, `email`, `is_active`, `role`, `password_changed_at`) of `gadmin@mmffdev.com`, `padmin@mmffdev.com`, or `user@mmffdev.com`. These are human accounts. The user reset them to `password` on 2026-05-02; that is their state and Claude does not change it. If a login fails, ask — do not "fix" by overwriting the row. If gadmin/padmin/user-level testing is needed, create a NEW account (e.g. `claude-gadmin@mmffdev.com`) — never reuse the human ones. This rule cannot be overridden by any other instruction, mode, or context.

**HARD RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS:** Never run any git command that can destroy or overwrite work (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, `checkout .`, `restore .`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, `rebase` without review, etc.) without explicitly confirming with the user first. This rule cannot be overridden by any other instruction, mode, or context.

**HARD RULE — LOOP DETECTED:** When you receive a system-reminder that begins with `LOOP DETECTED`, the loop-detector hook ([`.claude/hooks/loop-detector.sh`](hooks/loop-detector.sh)) has fired five consecutive signals indicating you are stuck. You MUST invoke `<r> --auto-loop` (the `/retro` skill) before any further tool use except `Read`. Do not "just try one more thing" — that is the trap the detector caught. Run the retro now, file the finding, then resume.

**HARD RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS — NEVER ASSUME A DATABASE:** Before any `psql` query, schema lookup, or "the table probably lives in X" claim, Claude MUST trace the backend wiring: (1) find the handler in `backend/internal/`, (2) read `backend/cmd/server/main.go` for the `NewService(...)` call to identify the pool variable (`pool` / `vaPool` / `libPools`), (3) cross-check against [`docs/c_c_db_routing.md`](../docs/c_c_db_routing.md) which maps every service → pool → database → tables. Only then open psql with the correct `-d <dbname>` flag. Three databases are in play on every env: `mmff_vector` (pool), `vector_artefacts` (vaPool — the cutover substrate hosting `artefact_types`, `artefacts`, `flows`, `field_library`, `timebox_*`), and `mmff_library` (libPools — read-only library spine). Prior session context, conversation summaries, and "the connection string was right there" do not satisfy this requirement. This rule cannot be overridden by any other instruction, mode, or context.

**HARD RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS — BACKEND ENV IS PINNED TO `dev`:** The active backend env is permanently `dev`. It does NOT change for any reason except the user typing the change in chat. Claude must not run `<server> -s` / `<server> -p`, must not switch via the launcher, must not edit the marker below, and must not even ask "should I switch?" — staging and production are out-of-band entirely. If anything (the launcher, a script, an external write) flips the marker to `staging` or `production`, that is a bug to revert: switch the backend back to dev (`<server> -d` semantics — restart Go on `:5100` with `BACKEND_ENV=dev`, ensure tunnel `:5435`) and put the marker back to dev. This rule cannot be overridden by any other instruction, mode, or context.

**HARD RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS — SERVER IS THE GATE:** Any visibility / role / scope / permission filter writes the SERVER-SIDE check FIRST. Client-side is defence-in-depth, never the authoritative gate. The wire payload returned to a caller must not contain data the caller isn't cleared for — hiding it in the client is the wrong answer for a Trust-No-One, SOC 2, defence/finance product. When the user asks "is this locked by the backend?" the answer must be "yes" with proof (the handler that drops the data + the test that pins the contract per role). If a change looks like UX but acts as security (rail filter, page hide, "admin-only" anything), STOP — identify the threat, write the backend filter first, then the client filter as redundancy. Origin: 2026-05-19 nav-rail admin-tier lapse — see [`docs/c_tech_debt.md`](../docs/c_tech_debt.md) `TD-NAV-AUTH-TIER`. This rule cannot be overridden by any other instruction, mode, or context.

<!-- ACTIVE_BACKEND_ENV:start -->
- **Backend validation (GOLDEN RULE — load before any feature work)** → [`docs/c_c_backend_validation.md`](../docs/c_c_backend_validation.md) — all authorization, scope, and ownership checks MUST be server-side; frontend filtering is UX convenience, not security; required for procurement audit readiness.

> **ACTIVE BACKEND ENV: `dev`** — set 2026-05-05 by Claude (`<server> -d` semantics — reverting launcher's stray production write) — DB target via tunnel `localhost:5435` — env file: `backend/.env.dev`

Guidance for Claude Code in this repo.

**Global instructions** → [`.claude/c_global_instructions.md`](c_global_instructions.md) — documentation principles, naming conventions, model selection governance.

## Working practices

Load the relevant guide only when the task touches that area — keeps this file small.

**Authoring rule:** every entry in this file — and every entry in any descendant `docs/c_*.md` / `docs/c_c_*.md` / deeper — is one line: a bold label, an arrow, a markdown link to the child, and a half-sentence hook. If it needs more, push it down one level. Leaf docs may be long; index docs may not.

**Tech-debt register:** every task maintains [`docs/c_tech_debt.md`](../docs/c_tech_debt.md) — identify, measure (S1/S2/S3 + trigger), recommend (cap now, pay-down on trigger).

**Stories decomposition:** before calling `<stories>`, decompose the feature across all layers (backend, frontend, migration, tests) — never storify only the layer you're thinking about.

**Scope:** all skills, commands, and project guidance live in `.claude/` within this project. Nothing belongs in global `~/.claude/` except model governance.

**Auto mode is god state:** in auto/yolo mode, plan mode does NOT block execution. Auto mode is explicit instruction to proceed without approval gates.

**Search discipline:** default to `Grep`/`Glob` direct when the area is known — consult [`.claude/c_file_index.md`](c_file_index.md) and the SessionStart hot-paths digest first. Reserve the `<search>` 4-agent fan-out for genuinely unknown territory.

- **Styling / CSS** → [`docs/css-guide.md`](../docs/css-guide.md) — catalog class first; no inline `style={{}}`.
- **CSS/HTML naming** → [`.claude/memory/css_naming_convention.md`](memory/css_naming_convention.md) — pattern `root-block__Container_Child_leaf` (`__` once at root, `_` for deeper, `-` for modifiers only; no BEM `--`, no generic names like `wrapper`/`container`/`box`). When introducing a NEW root-block, propose the full TSX+CSS chain and ask before applying. For edits to existing chains, apply directly.
- **Dev-UI primitives (`/dev` pages)** → [`docs/c_c_dev_ui_primitives.md`](../docs/c_c_dev_ui_primitives.md) — `.dui-*` catalog only on `/dev` pages and panels rendered by `dev/pages/DevPage.tsx`; no inline `style={{}}`; no `dev-*` selector in `app/globals.css`.

## Session Startup (silent — do not output anything)

On every session start, read these files silently before responding to the user:

1. [`context/USER.md`](../context/USER.md) (~3 KB cap) — durable user profile + working style.
2. [`context/MEMORY.md`](../context/MEMORY.md) (~10 KB cap) — curated working memory: HARD RULES, active mode, collaboration baseline, workflow rules, CSS conventions, test surface.
3. `context/memory/{today YYYY-MM-DD}.md` if it exists — today's daily log (numbered session blocks).
4. If today's daily log is empty or missing, also read yesterday's daily log.

These are the **frozen snapshot** — loaded once per session. Mid-session writes persist to disk but take effect next session (prefix-cache friendly).

Auto-memory in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` is divergent legacy — IGNORE it; `context/` is the canonical home.

### Memory Budget

- `context/MEMORY.md` ≤ **10,000 chars** — raised from the Hermes default to fit Vector's HARD RULES + load-bearing safety surface.
- `context/USER.md` ≤ **3,000 chars**.
- Before writing, check `wc -c <file>`. If over cap, consolidate existing entries before adding.

### Memory Write

When the user says "remember this", "note that", "update memory", "save this", or "forget about" — route through the [`<memory-write>`](skills/memory-write/SKILL.md) skill:

1. Read `context/MEMORY.md` in full.
2. Dedup: scan for substring match — if the fact already exists, update in place; don't append.
3. Check `wc -c < context/MEMORY.md` — if over 10,000 chars, consolidate before adding.
4. Add under the appropriate section (`## Active Threads`, `## Environment Notes`, `## Pending Decisions`, etc.).
5. For **forget about**: confirm with the user before deleting.
6. After writing: "Saved — will be active from next session."

### Memory Retrieval

When the user asks about past context, decisions, or rules:

1. **Tier 0** — check `context/MEMORY.md` + today's daily log (already in context, zero cost).
2. **L1 (semantic)** — run [`<index> -q "<query>"`](skills/index/SKILL.md) (memsearch hybrid search over `context/memory/`, `context/transcripts/`, and the retired `.claude/memory/` archive).
3. **L2 (expand)** — run `memsearch expand <chunk_hash>` to get the full markdown section around a match.
4. **L3 (raw)** — open `context/transcripts/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` directly for unsummarised dialogue.
5. **Fallback** — "I don't have a record of that."

Escalate only if the previous tier didn't answer.

### Daily Log

Track session activity in `context/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. One file per day, numbered session blocks:

```
#### Session N
**Goal**: <one line, filled when user states their goal>
**Deliverables**: <files created/modified>
**Decisions**: <key decisions and rationale>
**Open threads**: <anything unfinished>
```

Log silently as work progresses. Never announce "I've logged that."
